# Modelling and Simulation

## University of Lodz

Modelling and Simulation lecture projects

#### Projects
*  Simulate the evolution of dog-flea model, assuming that there are 20 fleas in the
system and that all fleas are sitting on one dog at time t=0. Record the states of the
system in first 20 time-steps. Check after how many iterations the system returns
to the initial state.

*  Use Monte Carlo simulation to approximate Ï€ number (generate at least 106
random points ).

* Prisoner's Dilemma strategies.
